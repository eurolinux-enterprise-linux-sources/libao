<h1>libao Plugin Writer's Overview</h1>

<p>
Plugins are drivers that are loaded dynamically when libao is first
initialized by the client application.  Drivers that are operating
system dependent, like the <tt>oss</tt> and <tt>sun</tt> drivers, or
that depend on external libraries, like the <tt>esd</tt> driver, must
be implemented as plugins in order to keep binary packagers happy.
There are also statically linked drivers, which are written in a
nearly identical way, but won't be covered here.  In nearly all cases,
a dynamically loadable plugin is the preferred way to write a driver,
and the required way if the driver depends upon any external
libraries.
</p>

<h2>Life Cycle</h2>

<p>
The life cycle of a plugin is:
<ul>
<li>When libao is first <a href="ao_initialize.html">initialized</a>,
it loads all of the plugins from disk.

<li>Libao then <a href="ao_plugin_test.html">tests</a> each plugin to
see if can be used as the default driver.

<li>When the user opens a device, libao will:

  <ul>

  <li>Call <a
  href="ao_plugin_device_init.html">ao_plugin_device_init()</a> to
  allow the plugin to allocate and initialize any private data
  structures it will use.

  <li>Call <a
  href="ao_plugin_set_option.html">ao_plugin_set_option()</a> for each
  parameter passed to the library by the client application.

  <li>Call <a href="ao_plugin_open.html">ao_plugin_open.html</a> to
  open the device for playback.
  
  </ul>

<li>Each time the client app calls <a
href="ao_play.html">ao_play()</a>, the library will reorder the byte
format (little-endian vs. big-endian) to match the format requested by
the plugin.  The library will then call <a href="ao_plugin_play.html">ao_plugin_play()</a> for the block of audio data.

<li>When the client app closes the audio device, the library calls <a
href="ao_plugin_close.html">ao_plugin_close()</a> to close the device,
followed by a call to <a
href="ao_plugin_clear.html">ao_plugin_device_clear()</a> to deallocate
the private data structures.

<li>When the library is <a href="ao_shutdown.html">shutdown</a>, the
plugin will be unloaded from memory.

</ul>

In case of errors, <a
href="ao_plugin_device_clear.html">ao_plugin_device_clear()</a> will
always be called if <a
href="ao_plugin_device_init.html">ao_plugin_device_init()</a> executed
successfully.  Similarly, <a
href="ao_plugin_close.html">ao_plugin_close()</a> will always be
called if <a href="ao_plugin_open.html">ao_plugin_open()</a> executed
successfully.
</p>

<h2>Creating a New Plugin</h2>

<p>
In order to write a new plugin, follow these steps:
<ul>

<li>Decide upon a new short name for your plugin.  It should be less
than 8 characters and contain only alphanumeric characters
(underscores are okay, but discouraged).

<li>Make a new directory in the src/plugins directory with the short name of your plugin.

<li>Copy the contents of one of the other plugin directories into your
directory.  The Sun driver is a good example of a driver that uses
system devices for output, and the ALSA driver is a good example of a
plugin that uses an external library.  Rename the source file to ao_shortname.c, where "shortname" is the short name of your plugin.

<li>Edit the <a href="ao_info.html">ao_info</a> structure.

<li>Implement the all of the methods defined in the <a
href="plugin-api.html">plugin API</a>.

<li>Edit the files ("shortname" is as described above): configure.in,
src/plugins/Makefile.am, src/plugins/shortname/Makefile.am.  There
should be a an configure option to disable your plugin.  Look at the
existing configure.in file for examples of how to do this.

<li>Test it thoroughly!  :)

<li>Send a tarball of the src/plugin/shortname directory (only this
directory, please!) and a cvs diff -u of the changes you have made to
the <a href="mailto:vorbis-dev@xiph.org">vorbis-dev</a> list and we'll
take a look at it for inclusion.

</ul>
</p>

<h2>API Implementation Tips</h2>

<p>
<ul>

<li>Remember to close any devices/connections you openned in <a
href="ao_plugin_test.html">ao_plugin_test()</a>.  <li>Although you
should try to allocate all of your data structures in <a
href="ao_plugin_device_init.html">ao_plugin_device_init()</a>, there
are cases where you won't be able to allocate memory until <a
href="ao_plugin_open.html">ao_plugin_open()</a> is called.  That is
acceptable, but the rule is that you must deallocate memory in <a
href="ao_plugin_close.html">ao_plugin_close()</a> that was allocated
in <a href="ao_plugin_open.html">ao_plugin_open()</a> and deallocate
memory in <a
href="ao_plugin_device_clear.html">ao_plugin_device_clear()</a> that
was allocated in <a
href="ao_plugin_device_init.html">ao_plugin_device_init()</a>.

<li>Don't forget to set device->driver_byte_format in <a
href="ao_plugin_open.html">ao_plugin_open()</a> to the byte ordering
your plugin needs.  The libao core will reorder the bytes for you if
it necessary.

<li>Read the <a href="drivers.html">driver documentation</a> to see
what priority you should set for your plugin in the <a
href="ao_info.html">ao_info</a> structure.

</ul>
